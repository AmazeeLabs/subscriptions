subscriptions.module README
==============================================================================

The subscriptions module allows users to subscribe to nodes or taxonomies.  A
subscribed user will be emailed whenever a comment is updated or added to a
node.  When this module is enabled, all nodes will display a new link,
"(un)subscribe", which enable users to subscribe or unsubscribe to the node in 
question.  A new menu option, "my subscriptions",  allows the user to
view all current subscriptions and make modifications.

Because this module causes the post insert\update to pause while all subscribers
are emailed, it may not be practical for some large sites.  

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Required:
  - Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
    common method is:
        mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < subscriptions.mysql
  - Copy subscriptions.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
  - Grant permissions to the groups you wish to be able to subscribe.
  - subscribe to nodes

    NOTE:  This module requires email addresses, so anonymous users don't make
 much sense.  Any user without an email address will generate a log error.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration, other than the permissions mentioned above,
at this time.  There is a single user setting under "my accounts" to enable
autosubscriptions.
