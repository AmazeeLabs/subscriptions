subscriptions.module README
==============================================================================

The subscriptions module allows users to subscribe to nodes.  A subscribed 
user will be emailed whenever a comment is updated or added to a node.  When 
this module is enabled, all nodes will display a new link, "subscriptions", 
which takes users to a page that will allow them to subscribe or unsubscribe 
to the node in question.  This page also allows the user to view all current
subscriptions

Because this module causes the comment insert to pause while all subscribers 
are emailed, it may not be practical for large sites.  

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Required:
  - Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
    common method is:
        mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < subscriptions.mysql
  - Copy subscriptions.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
  - Grant permissions to the groups you wish to be able to subscribe.  
subscribe to nodes


    NOTE:  This module requires email addresses, so anonymous users don't make
 much sense.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration, other than the permissions mentioned above.

ToDo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One proposed improvement would have the module insert mail to be sent into a 
table, which would then be cleared out by cronjob.  This table, however, and 
its controlling module, does not currently exist.  Another proposed 
improvement would extend this functionality to taxonomies.  Not sure how that 
would work, so that will have to be someone else.
