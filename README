subscriptions.module README
==============================================================================

The subscriptions module allows users to subscribe to nodes or taxonomies.  A 
subscribed user will be emailed whenever a comment is updated or added to a 
node.  When this module is enabled, all nodes will display a new link, 
"subscriptions", which takes users to a page that will allow them to subscribe 
or unsubscribe to the node in question.  This page also allows the user to 
view all current subscriptions.

Because this module causes the comment insert to pause while all subscribers 
are emailed, it may not be practical for large sites.  It will be compatable 
with mailqueue.module when that module is avaiulable.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Required:
  - Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
    common method is:
        mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < subscriptions.mysql
  - Copy subscriptions.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
  - Grant permissions to the groups you wish to be able to subscribe.  
subscribe to nodes

    NOTE:  This module requires email addresses, so anonymous users don't make
 much sense.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration, other than the permissions mentioned above,
at this time.

Credits / Contact
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original author of this module is Dan Ziemecki, who can be reached at
c0c0c0@geeknetwork.org.  Other contributors are not aware that I stole their 
code.

ToDo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One proposed improvement would have the module insert mail to be sent into a 
table, which would then be cleared out by cronjob.  This table, however, and 
its controlling module, does not currently exist.  The module that supports 
this, mailqueue, is currently in development.
