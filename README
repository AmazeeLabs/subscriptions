subscriptions.module README
==============================================================================

The subscriptions module allows users to subscribe to nodes or taxonomies.  A
subscribed user will be emailed whenever a comment is updated or added to a
node.  When this module is enabled, all nodes will display a new link,
"subscriptions", which takes users to a page that will allow them to subscribe
or unsubscribe to the node in question.  This page also allows the user to
view all current subscriptions.

Because this module causes the comment insert to pause while all subscribers
are emailed, it may not be practical for large sites.  It will be compatable
with mailqueue.module when that module is avaiulable.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Required:
  - Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the most
    common method is:
        mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < subscriptions.mysql
  - Copy subscriptions.module to modules/
  - Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
  - Grant permissions to the groups you wish to be able to subscribe.
subscribe to nodes

    NOTE:  This module requires email addresses, so anonymous users don't make
 much sense.

Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module needs no configuration, other than the permissions mentioned above,
at this time.  There is a single user setting under "my accounts" to enable
autosubscriptions.

Credits / Contact
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original author of this module is Dan Ziemecki, who can be reached at
c0c0c0@geeknetwork.org.  Tom Dobes provided additional fixes and upgraded the
module to function with Drupal post-4.3 CVS.

ToDo
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One proposed improvement would have the module insert mail to be sent into a
table, which would then be cleared out by cronjob. The module that supports
this, mailqueue, is currently in development and is only waiting on an appropriate
login hook to clear the "since last visited" queue.
